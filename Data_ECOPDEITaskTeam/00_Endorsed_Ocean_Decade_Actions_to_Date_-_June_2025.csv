The rate of the ocean's changing chemistry is measured by a suite of stations worldwide, and conditions expected by 2100 will have a number of negative effects on marine life.  Many challenges to understanding OA and its impacts remain. A robust understanding of OA and its impacts requires interdisciplinary monitoring and research efforts, including carbonate chemistry, physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, biology, natural resource economics, and other social and hard sciences. It also requires a global workforce that is capable of analyzing, assessing, and applying this data.

These connections range from one-on-one to small group discussions and often transcend national borders to bring a global perspective to the mentoring experience.    The mentoring platform can be integrated into the online experience for specific Decade events or related activities including Ocean Sciences Meeting, Ocean Visions Summit, and AGUâ€™s Annual Fall Meeting with more than 25,000 scientists in attendance. In addition, the platform can also leverage other training capacities of AGU to further enhance the mentoring experience, such as professional trainings on communicating effectively with policy makers, the media, and public as well as fellowship opportunities through the Thriving Earth Exchange to learn how to work directly with local communities to co-create solutions. In discussions with representatives of the Early Career Ocean Professionals Programme, there was strong interest in leveraging M365 to support their programming needs and they have provided a letter of support for this proposal (attached).

239,Active,Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022-2030,Call for Decade Actions No 01/2020,Contribution,American Geophysical Union,United States of America (USA),"Ocean Sciences Meetings, with global outreach and online and onsite programming, will serve as a catalyst for convening thousands of the worldâ€™s leading oceanographers and will continue to extend its reach through a growing global group of affiliated communities and partners.    The Ocean Sciences Meeting, which has been held since 1984, proposes an in-kind contribution by providing a venue to promote connections between the Ocean Decade with oceanography community-scientists, NGOs, non-profit organizations, and the private sector.  Additionally, the coalition of partners will bring more attention to the UN Decade outside of this biennial meeting.    The conference scientific program committee for each meeting, which includes representatives from all three societies, would discuss how to prioritize the Decade at each conference between 2022-2030 and consider what partners or what focus would enhance collaboration and knowledge-sharing on sustainable oceans with a focus on the ocean we want for the future. Ocean Sciences Meetings will provide the opportunity to convene sessions on specific applications and priority areas of sustainable development throughout the decade. Participants also include representatives from NGOs, government agencies worldwide, other non-profit agencies, and private-sector organizations in the ocean sciences. Solution projects and outcomes, white papers, scientific journal articles, or other collateral are likely outcomes from each meeting and will expand the reach and timeline of the in-kind contribution. In addition, the coalition of sponsoring societies (AGU, ASLO, TOS) brings the ability to have a continuum of UN Decade work and focus beyond OSM through ASLOâ€™s annual Aquatic Science Meeting, TOSâ€™s meetings and communications channels, and AGUâ€™s 25,000-person annual meeting and other conferences. In addition, there are other potential synergies in areas of each association.    The UN Decade would become a supporter of Ocean Sciences Meetings throughout the decade and given the opportunity to host town halls, workshops, and provide speakers or information about the UN Decade. The UN Decade logo could be used in all major OSM marketing.    Additional goals of these events are to highlight the oceanâ€™s importance to society and to support the Decade of Ocean science vision to â€œdevelop scientific knowledge, build infrastructure and foster relationships for a sustainable and healthy ocean.â€    The OSM team is asking for an endorsement for the 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028, and 2030 meetings.

Our products are available through selected retailers and e-commerce sites. Focusing on transparency, circularity, and recycled materials, Piping Hot is a signatory to the UN Global Compact, with a particular focus on ocean protection. We propose creating a fashion collaboration featuring Ocean Decade communications to promote ocean literacy and a more sustainable ocean. We will work with ocean scientists and ocean decade stakeholders to determine relevant messages that will be developed into graphics and text for swing tags that are attached to garments and graphics that can be incorporated onto/into clothing that are promoted in line with shared ocean decade objectives.
Through fashion, we can access a diverse audience and by directing messaging via products increase their awareness and understanding of the ocean and its value to society. By partnering with the Decade, we can amplify key initiative messages and encourage consumers to adjust their behaviours to better value, conserve and sustainably support the ocean. Our customer base is connected to the ocean and has shown a willingness to take action to protect it. We have distribution in multiple countries including Australia, Japan and China and so therefore have the potential to be wide-reaching in our messaging.
The Ocean Decade will benefit from visibility in retail environments, on social media and through PR exposure. We propose working in partnership with the UN Decade Secretariat, CSIRO and other Australian Decade partners to align with key dates and campaigns. In this regard, we have already participated in the first UN Decade stakeholder briefing held in Australia and have begun a partnering conversation with Australian stakeholders involved in the UN Decade.",06/08/2021,12/31/2030,NA,NA,Kelly Yap,kelly@futuritybrands.com,Not applicable,https://oceandecade.org/actions/Piping-Hot-x-UN-Decade-of-Ocean-Science-for-Sustainable-Development/
500,Closed,Ocean Literacy Toolkit for Governments,Rolling basis submission,Contribution,AXA XL,France,"The ocean is our planet’s defining feature, containing up to 80% of all life, driving weather patterns, and providing food and jobs for half the world. However, despite the importance of the ocean, it is rarely incorporated into formal education. This lack of education has meant that the importance of a healthy ocean is rarely taken into account in business or policy decision-making.    Ocean literacy is an understanding of the ocean’s influence on people and people’s influence on the ocean. To build a more sustainable future, it is essential to cultivate this awareness and educate young people on the importance of the ocean and how we are impacting its health in order to develop a generation of leaders that are able to incorporate sustainability into their decision-making.    IOC-UNESCO is working with education partner Encounter Edu to develop an Ocean Literacy Toolkit for Governments. This work is supported financially by AXA XL, building off AXA XL’s Ocean Education programme and a 25-year legacy of supporting ocean research. AXA Ocean Education has worked to increase ocean literacy globally since 2012, so far reaching over 9 million children in 96 countries.    The Toolkit will be a resource for policymakers and education professionals to incorporate ocean literacy into formal education curricula. The Toolkit will provide an overview of why ocean literacy is important and how curriculum development has evolved to provide opportunities to integrate sustainable education. It will highlight best practices from countries that have been successful in integrating ocean literacy in curricula, including assessing different approaches and lessons learned. The case study examples will examine: UK, Canada, Portugal, Japan, South Africa, New Zealand, Seychelles, and Costa Rica. The Toolkit will outline a phased approach to building ocean literacy into curricula and include an implementation checklist on how to engage stakeholders, resource a new curriculum, and train and support teachers.    The Toolkit will be launched in late 2021 alongside engagement with countries that will commit to using the Toolkit. This engagement will continue into 2022 and beyond with the aim of continuing to support countries, policymakers, and educators on how to develop ocean literacy in the classroom and implement it as part of formal education curricula. It will also be paired with AXA XL and Encounter Edu’s development of additional free, publicly available teaching resources for AXA Ocean Education, including toolkits for localizing education resources to practically implement ocean literacy in the classroom.

Yet, our knowledge of the fate of beached Marine Plastic Debris (MPD) remains limited. We propose a novel approach based on repeated field-surveys of surface and buried MPD and studying physico-chemical transformations induced by MPD aging on Hawaiian beaches, which are known hot-spots for MPD due to their proximity to the North Pacific Garbage Patch. Repeated field-survey data of surface and buried MPD on beaches will generate dynamic 3D maps of beached MPD which will provide a better understanding of beach attributes that evoke MDP trapping, accumulation and mobility. Following the aging of plastic debris when stored on beaches will reveal dominating MPD transformations and rates, including fragmentation rates, which will provide key information to model fate of MPD.",01/05/2022,18/08/2025,"Challenge 1: Marine Pollution

For example, sediment cores obtained by scientific ocean drilling have contributed as paleoclimate archives to reveal the processes and mechanisms that drive global climate change. The international framework of IODP (International Ocean Discovery Program), has been registered as a Contribution of Decade Action. As the Japanese representative scientific community of IODP, J-DESC (Japan Drilling Earth Science Consortium: J-DESC, established in 2003) will contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science promotion as one of the “platforms” providing communication among scientists, students, and the general public.
J-DESC has actively engaged in hypothesis-driven, bottom-up, and international science collaborations through open communication with international colleagues. J-DESC has been promoting its science by organizing workshops for scientists and students, and symposiums for wider members of societies including the general public, decision-makers, children, etc. Also, J-DESC has been providing hands-on training courses to early career ocean professionals (ECOPs) and students who are not familiar with the scientific ocean drilling and its science. In 2019, J-DESC made this core school open to Asian societies as an international core school and received nine international students and ECOPs as trainees. In addition, J-DESC recently started a new program for providing graduate students with the opportunity to participate in scientific drilling expeditions along with scientists for opening the eyes of students with real experience to get on board. About 10 days of expedition participation is open to graduate students in Japanese universities. Nine students got on board with this new program in 2021, the real experiences were extremely stimulating to the students, and they enhanced their literacy of ocean sciences.
Above examples are all J-DESC’s established and active paths to the wide range of stakeholders in Japan and Asia, J-DESC aims to expand its function to be a promotion/communication body (i.e. ""platform”) for the UN Decade of Ocean Sciences in the Decade Contributions by facilitating public scientific communication, as well as promoting peer-to-peer collaboration and mentoring.

Its mission is to empower the next generation of leaders by connecting them in purpose, educating them on the intersection of environmental and humanitarian crises they are inheriting, and cultivating essential skills to create innovative solutions and real-world change. H2OO’s programs include youth advisory councils, youth summits, youth-led initiatives, and more. 

H2OO organized the world’s first Youth Advisory Council for the UN Ocean Decade in the U.S. (U.S. YAC UNOD) in 2020, with successful cohorts each year and now a team of supporting alumni. 

H2OO believes the next generation of leaders and decision makers should have a meaningful “seat at the table” during the Decade, and that all youth should have an opportunity to develop essential real-world skills now, especially empathetic leadership skills.

H2OO is engaged as a Decade Implementation Partner (DIP) to engage youth in the Decade, including assist UN Member States to form their own meaningful youth advisory council for the Decade. H2OO created a comprehensive toolkit to assist and is available for consultation in forming a YAC. 

A 14 year old youth at the start of the Decade will be 24 years at the end of it. The best way to turn the tide of the crises their generation is inheriting is to engage them meaningfully now, because then making change for good will be deeply a part of their beings as they enter their careers.

Step 1:
(1) A special programme of the ""UN Decade International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at Peking University"" will be announced on Monday 27 June in Chinese and English. In fact, we have interviewed the first postdoctoral fellow who will join the programme from 1st August. The programme is open to researchers who are willing to engage in research directly related to the Ocean Decade goals and priorities from all over the world. 
(2) We plan to organise and sponsor the Advanced Thematic Seminars on ""Seeking Science-Based Solutions"" once a year at PKU. Once we are formally approved as a DIP, we shall establishan advisory committee and start to plan the Seminars. The participants are expected to be from around the world. The focus will be on specific problems related to UN Decade goals. In this seminar series, PKU and the relevant departments of the Chinese government will invite experts at home and abroad to lecture and provide the participants with opportunities for on-site research or practice. 
(3) The 1st Weihai Forum will be held on 6-7 August, 2022. Weihai Forum is designed to be an annual meeting with an overall theme of ""Ocean Sustainable Development Driven by Science-Technology Innovation”. We hope to develop this Forum into one of the high-level international communication platforms on key issues related to the UN Decade goals and priorities. The government of Weihai City (a coastal city in Shandong Province, which won the 2003 UN “Habitat Scroll of Honor Award”) has expressed their strong interests in hosting such a forum annually.
Step 2:
(1) Launch the Ocean Decade Capacity Building Alliance with universities and research institutions to strengthen the capacity building in the marine field and improving the marine literacy of the whole society by sharing education and research resources.

There aremany island groups, and a number of disputed territorial boundaries and geopolitical tensions. Compared with the North Atlantic and North Pacific the region is relatively poorly charted outside of the exclusive economic zones of the nations that bound the Indian Ocean, and to date there has been limited industrial activity extracting subsea energy or mineral  resources outside of some of the regional EEZs.

It has set forth two key objectives: firstly, to align its objectives and outcomes with those of the Ocean Supercluster, and secondly, to increase the economic value of solutions that restore the world’s oceans to a sustainable state of health.
The overarching vision of the Ocean Program is to create “a thriving ocean economy within a thriving ocean environment (aka, a thriving blue economy) – Ocean health, Ocean wealth”. Its mission is dedicated to generating knowledge and developing technologies, through collaborations, partnerships, and self- directed research, to improve ocean health, and use the ocean’s immense potential to benefit Canada’s economy and address the world’s climate problem in a sustainable and inclusive manner.",11/09/2023,31/12/2027,"Challenge 1: Marine Pollution

As the guiding strategic plan, ODCC will carry out “Eight Major Marine Actions”. Articulated in the ODCC 2030 Developmental Plan, by the year 2030, ODCC aims to cultivate and launch 3-5 Decade Programmes, initiate 8-10 Decade Projects, and organise pilot implementation in Qingdao for 5 Decade Programmes. This may involve collaborative efforts with partner organisations (e.g. research institutes, universities, international organisations) and co-design processes through support to working groups or meetings of diverse groups of actors. ODCC also aims to support the operation and activities of ECOP China Node and fund youth programmes. We will mainly focus on energising marine science and technology innovation, proposing science-based solutions, protecting and restoring marine ecosystems, preserving marine biodiversity, boosting blue economy and sustainable marine industrial development, and engaging the public and promoting ocean literacy and education.   
  
ODCC will commit to convening Ocean Decade partners via existing networks, such as the Ocean Decade “Cities with the Ocean” platform. Qingdao is one of the founding cities of the platform, and ODCC has been the main actor coordinating Qingdao’s engagement in the network and implementing the work. ODCC is also partnering with several leading domestic and international marine organisations, research institutes, and businesses. In the following years, ODCC is eager to raise awareness about the Decade and facilitate new partnerships and collaborations for the co-design of Decade Actions.   
  
Besides, ODCC desires to contribute to communications and outreach including sharing of Ocean Decade communications, translation and adaptation of communications assets to local languages and contexts, and providing local or thematic content for use in global communications. ODCC has been providing translation services to all the related materials in Qingdao’s engagement in the Ocean Decade Conference and the “Cities with the Ocean” platform to facilitate communications between local authorities and the international Ocean Decade community. ODCC has translated the Barcelona Declaration into Chinese to enable a wider recognition and impact in China. In the future, ODCC aims to keep putting effort into producing, translating, and sharing communications assets and serving as a bridge of communication between China (especially Qingdao) and the world in the Ocean Decade initiative.  
  
Finally, ODCC will actively support the meetings and conferences of the Ocean Decade, including major international conferences, regional or national workshops or events, and Decade events on the sidelines of other major conferences or meetings. In September 2023, ODCC co-organised the international launching conference of DCC-OCC. In 2025, Qingdao Municipality will host and co-organise the 2025 Ocean Decade Coastal Cities Conference with IOC/UNESCO, and ODCC will be a major actor commissioned by the Municipal Government in the planning, coordination and implementation of the Conference. ",01/07/2024,31/07/2027,"Challenge 2: Protect and Restore Ecosystems,  Challenge 4: Sustainable Ocean Economy,  Challenge 6: Coastal Resilience, Challenge 10: Behaviour Change",NA,Wei Zheng,zhengwei@fio.org.cn ,Not applicable,https://oceandecade.org/actions/ocean-decade-international-cooperation-center-china/

AN01,Active,An ecosystem approach to quantifying behavioural and energetic impacts of anthropogenic disturbance to Arctic whales,ArcticNet,Project,Dalhousie University ,Canada,"Arctic marine mammals are living in a rapidly changing environment. However, the impacts of increasing human activity on northern whale species and populations is poorly understood. Specifically, the loss of pristine conditions from anthropogenic sources of noise is anticipated to lead to varying levels of impact ranging from acoustic masking and behavioural disturbance to extreme cases of hearing loss and death. Furthermore, risk of serious injury or mortality from increased vessel traffic in the Canadian Arctic is of growing concern for whale species. We are seeking to employ a multi-faceted research approach using an experimental control study to quantify acoustic impacts of vessel noise and sonar exposure on Arctic whales and assess ship strike risk. Combining aerial behavioural observations (drones) with underwater biologging technology (long-term and coarse scale satellite telemetry tags with timedepth recorders logging 2D movement over horizontal and vertical planes and shortterm high-resolution biologgers recording 3D dive behaviour and received sound), prey field mapping (oceanographic sampling) and vessel location and noise data (AIS), we will determine how: 1) anthropogenic noise impacts Arctic whale behaviour and vocalizations (call and echolocation rates)?; 2) diving behaviour affects vessel strike risk; 3) we can mitigate impacts to reduce risk of disturbance, injury and mortality. The outcomes of our research will directly support risk mitigation actions by the Department of National Defense regarding using sonar in the Arctic and will contribute to Fisheries and Oceans Canada adaptive responses to marine shipping and environmental impacts on Arctic whales.

AN02,Closed,Rapidly changing ecosystem dynamics in the Arctic Ocean’s Last Ice Area,ArcticNet,Project,University of Brunswick,Canada,"The Arctic Ocean (AO) is a key component of Earth's climate, acting as a coolant by contributing ~10% to the global oceanic carbon pump. Its capacity to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere comes from its cold waters that favour CO2 dissolution and its highly productive continental shelves that help sequester this carbon. Yet, the AO is warming at an unprecedented rate and the local and global consequences of its rapid evolution remain uncertain. The Last Ice Area (LIA), north of Canada and Greenland, is the last sanctuary of multiyear sea ice in the AO. The LIA includes the Lincoln Sea, which hosts unique endemic sea ice-dependent ecosystems. However, the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Lincoln Sea remain nearly undocumented. RED-AO aims at improving understanding of how global change influences ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling in northern Baffin Bay and the Lincoln Sea – an emblematic refuge of climate change. This project proposes a pioneer oceanographic expedition during which, for the first time, sea ice, hydrography, biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and contaminants, and marine ecosystems will be observed simultaneously. It will provide a comprehensive baseline for conservation efforts and allow us to study key processes related to past, present, and future climate-induced changes.

AN03,Closed,Future Arctic Mobilities: Informing transportation adaptation through climate observations and model produjections of changing snow and ice,ArcticNet,Project,York University,Canada,"The coastal and inland communities distributed across the Canadian Arctic depend on safe, accessible, and affordable transportation routes to support regional economic development, and to underpin sustainable livelihoods, culture, and food security. In the winter, transportation requires sea ice, freshwater ice, and snow to be thick enough to sustain the weight of snowmobiles and trucks. In the summer, navigational routes and harbours in the ocean need to be sufficiently free of sea ice to permit safe shipping activity. Climate change has decreased the duration, extent, and thickness of the cryosphere in the Arctic, including sea ice, freshwater ice on lakes and rivers, and snow cover. This loss of reliable, and safe transportation conditions has direct implications for mobility in the Arctic, both marine and overland. In this project, we aim to forecast the availability of suitable marine shipping routes and overland winter trails and ice roads under global warming scenarios of 1-4ºC above pre-industrial (1850-1900) times. We have assembled a strong transdisciplinary team to develop climate mobility projections for local communities, in order to better inform local adaptation efforts. Ultimately, our goal is to provide climate model projections of key cryosphere variables (snow, freshwater ice, sea ice) and their drivers (temperature, precipitation) at the regional and community-level scales across the Canadian Arctic that can be used to better understand the impacts, risks, and adaptation options available to support safe local and regional marine and overland mobilities.",01/04/2022,01/03/2024,"Challenge 5: Ocean-Climate Nexus

However, these areas are also dangerous and prone to break-off events with a combination of wind, current, and temperature changes, or unexpected weather events. Break-off events are not well-understood or modelled using scientific methods, and changes in the Arctic climate are making assessment of travel safety on sea ice using Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit more challenging. Our project builds on existing SmartICE monitoring underway in each community, but is specifically targeted to address community concerns around predicting break-off events.

In the context of a changing environment, consequences of these anthropogenic stressors on fish reproductive biology and offspring require further study, warranted by the fundamental relevance of these life stages for the population to be able to adapt to these stressors. Indeed, our preliminary data highlighted fascinating and underexplored atypical reproductive patterns in Northeast Atlantic cod that the current knowledge cannot explain. These changes in reproductive cycle, potentially related to elevated temperatures, could result in shifts in spawning season from spring to autumn. Under the ongoing climate change, the occurrence of these atypical phenomena in Atlantic cod would be expected to increase. However, the consequences of these changes on reproductive and offspring performance are unknown. The proposed project is designed to explore the potential anthropogenic impacts of climate change (i.e., temperature) and fisheries on male and female Atlantic cod reproductive biology and physiology, in particular examining if these stressors are drivers of the atypical patterns observed, and the consequences on offspring. By combining experimental, laboratory and field studies, several stocks across different latitudes of the iconic Atlantic cod will be investigated and findings will be compared to species presenting different life-history traits, the Atlantic haddock, and herring.

However, there is no practical method to obtain blood samples from large free-swimming cetaceans. While possible for smaller species, it obligates the capture and restraint of these individuals, which can be logistically challenging for researchers, and stressful for the animal. Thus, the most widely used sampling technique for free-ranging cetaceans remains remote tissue biopsying, which is considered invasive, even if minimally, as it causes a small lesion on the animal. Nevertheless, in recent years, novel and promising ways of examining whale health are being developed using cetacean exhaled breath or “blow”, collected non-invasively - from the detection of hormones and other metabolites, microbiological studies, genetic markers to determine sex, species, or individual identification and there is strong potential to be used for the discovery of new biomarkers of health. In human medicine, the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as non-invasive biomarkers in biological fluids, including exhaled breath condensates, has been well established20. As such many model species already have miRNAomes available; however, miRNAs have not been carefully studied in wildlife species, including cetaceans.

NOR07  ,Active,Characterizing the migratory strategies of Atlantic lumpfish to improve stock assessment of this commercially important species (ECOLUMP),Research Council of Norway,Project,Institute of Marine Research,Norway,"The main impediment to stock assessment and management of Atlantic lumpfish comes from the lack of knowledge concerning its population structure and migration patterns. Lumpfish sustains two types of fisheries: one targeting females for their roe, the other targeting mature individuals to produce cleaner fish for salmon aquaculture. Studies on lumpfish population genetics so far have been somewhat contradictory. Some have shown little to no structure along the Norwegian coast, while others have revealed clear genetic differences and cryptic groupings even at a local level. Lumpfish is semipelagic fish that spawns in shallow coastal areas in the spring. The rest of its life cycle is spent offshore in pelagic feeding areas. However, the presence of immature adults in coastal areas as well as anecdotal spawning events in autumn question the current description of the lifecycle. In project ECOLUMP, we hypothesize that some individuals do not migrate offshore but feed in coastal areas and that these individuals constitute a separate subpopulation or ecotype than the migratory individuals. To uncover this alternate life strategy, we will use an interdisciplinary approach including population genetics, and methods that will allow us to retrace the migratory history of the fish (i.e. microchemistry of calcified structures and stable isotope analyses). A non-lethal biopsy will be developed to determine individual ecotypes. The proportion of resident and migratory lumpfish targeted by both types of fisheries will be quantified during the project. Acoustic telemetry will be used on coastal lumpfish to further document their coastal-offshore movements and behavior after spawning. We will also test whether lumpfish display different innate orientation and migratory tendencies by comparing their swimming behaviors and orientation cues (visual or magnetic) in the sea and in a laboratory.",15/9/2023,31/12/2027,"Challenge 2: Protect and Restore Ecosystems, Challenge 3: Sustainable Blue Food, Challenge 4: Sustainable Ocean Economy",NA,Caroline Durif,caroline.durif@hi.no,Not yet defined,https://oceandecade.org/actions/characterizing-migratory-strategies-of-atlantic-lumpfish-ecolump/

This requires the development and use of sensor systems able to generate heterogeneous datasets that need to be analyzed and interpreted to detect possible patterns that could be used as Operational Welfare Indicators (OWI) to trigger warning actions. The number of individuals per unit in modern fish farms (up to 200 000 fish per cage/tank) renders the use of conventional individual based welfare monitoring methods difficult. There is therefore an industrial need for new sensor systems and more automated and effective procedures for analysis that can provide reliable and continuous insights on how fish welfare on a group level is  affected by the production environment. BIOWASYS aims to establish a foundation for a non-invasive biological warning system for fish farming by using behavioural responses to assess welfare impacts of external and internal environmental parameters during production. This will entail acquiring new knowledge on the complex 3D environmental conditions, the spatiotemporal distribution of selected pathogens inside sea cages and farms and data describing their interactions. The project will also seek to identify biological parameters that can be used to detect and register fish responses toward changes in these parameters. The work will therefore also include developing a new non-invasive and automatised fish welfare and health monitoring procedure based on group behaviour analyses. Data acquired with this procedure will finally be correlated with data on the conditions in the cage to unveil how variations in the cage environment, pathogen distribution dynamics and occurrence impacts fish welfare status.",1/1/24,30/09/2027,"Challenge 1: Marine Pollution, Challenge 3: Sustainable Blue Food, Challenge 4: Sustainable Ocean Economy",NA,Pascal Klebert,pascal.klebert@sintef.no,Not yet defined,https://oceandecade.org/actions/non-invasive-biological-warning-systems-biowasys/

However, there has been increased interest recently in how such resources may benefit modern societies. This interdisciplinary project uses ethnohistorical sources, archaeological survey and excavations, and scientific analysis of samples from archaeological sites to work towards a holistic understanding of marine resource use and its impact on settlement patterns and lifeways along the west coast of Norway from the Viking Age to the Early Modern Period. To achieve this, we will examine historical records of marine resource use, as well as excavating coastal archaeological sites and surveying them from land and sea. Many past studies of coastal sites have focused on the productivity of commercial fisheries, but we aim to explore the lived experience of the inhabitants of these communities. However, we are working against the clock: many such sites are greatly at risk from the increasing coastal erosion caused by climate change. We are particularly interested in driftwood, which was used as fuel and timber in many coastal communities, especially north of Stad, and is now declining due to climate change and increased river management. We will develop a method to identify driftwood in the archaeological record, thus allowing us to better understand its past use. Other samples from our excavations will provide material for student projects, building local expertise in environmental archaeology. We will also explore modern drift material: where past communities collected driftwood, we now find plastic pollution. Through films, workshops, and a touring exhibition, we will connect the marine resources exploited in the past with what washes up on the shore in the present, raising awareness of the diverse potential of marine gathered resources and encouraging more conscious interactions with our coasts and oceans.",1/1/24,31/12/2027,Challenge 10: Behaviour Change,NA,Dr. Dawn Elise Mooney,dawn.e.mooney@uis.no,69.

While traditional population identification methods have often failed to resolve these issues, genomic methods have revealed clarity in the identification of marine populations, and the underlying mechanisms tunings their distributions. A key player in ecosystems throughout the north-eastern Atlantic having a complex population structure is the commercially important and highly valued Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). HERPOPS, based on the use of innovative genomic research, including wild populations with up to 100 years of data, will explore the processes influencing population structure in relation to climate change of herring. A recently established genomic method using population-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers will be used to identify the population of origin for individual herring. By applying this genomic method over a large-scale area, both in space and time, this project will obtain completely new and in-depth information about the spatiotemporal distribution of herring populations. Furthermore, HERPOPS will apply environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses to identify small-scale dynamics of spring and autumn spawning herring on a local spawning ground. This will help to answer if spawning type switching is a prevalent trait affecting metapopulation dynamics. HERPOPS aims to take the advantage of the new knowledge to assess the abundance of different populations having

NOR12  ,Active,Migratory Crossroads: predicting the dynamics of a great vertical migration in a changing habitat,Research Council of Norway,Project,Akvaplan-niva,Norway,"Vertical migration of zooplankton is known as the greatest synchronized animal movement of our planet. In the coastal and offshore waters of northern Norway, a tiny herbivorous copepod named Calanus finmarchicus performs two different vertical migrations. These include daily vertical movements of tens-to-hundreds of meters (diel vertical migration) and seasonal movements of hundreds-to-thousands of meters (seasonal vertical migration) in response to corresponding variations of irradiance, temperature, food availability and visual predation risk. These migrations play a paramount ecological and economic role because vertical behaviour, abundance and phenology of many commercially harvested fish species are linked to these and vertical migrations contribute to the export of atmospheric carbon into the ocean's deep interior – a key process in the buffering of climate change. However, due to rapid rate of climate change, routine diel & seasonal environmental variability under which these migrations occur keep shifting unprecedentedly, and little is known about how vertical migrations of C. finmarchicus would respond to these environmental shifts. While the current understanding of the subject matter is rooted in studying the impacts of single environmental variables on vertical migrations, in the proposed project, Migratory Crossroads, we aim to study the cumulative impacts of irradiance, temperature, food and predation environmental shifts expected in future high-latitude marine habitats on C. finmarchicus diel and seasonal vertical migrations. This will be done using a hybrid meahanistic-empirical approach, where predictions of a simulation model with an unconstrained representation of vertical migrations will be validated with cutting-edge high-resolution field data.

NOR13  ,Active,From Climate Drivers to Antarctic Ice Sheet Response: Improving Accuracy in Sea Level Rise Projections,Research Council of Norway,Project,Akvaplan-niva,Norway,"The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) stores a large amount of freshwater. If melted completely, it would contribute 58 m to global mean sea level rise. According to IPCC AR6, a rise of up to 5 m by 2150 cannot be ruled out under a highemission scenario due to the large uncertainty related to AIS processes. Such a strong increase in sea level would be catastrophic for many low-lying regions worldwide, but how likely is it? The AIS gains mass mainly through snow accumulation and loses mass through iceberg calving and ocean-induced basal melting of its floating parts. Future projections of AIS mass balance are based on ice sheet model simulations forced by climate model outputs. Climate models can properly project large-scale climate changes but struggle to represent small-scale coastal processes that bring heat to the ice sheet margins. This leads to poor representation of basal melting and thus substantial uncertainties in projections of Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise. Climate models also suggest compensating mass change under climate warming in Dronning Maud Land: increased basal melting and more snowfall. This project brings together glaciology and oceanography, sophisticated numerical modelling and statistical analysis techniques to address these two key uncertainties of sea level rise projections: 1) Our combined approach of ocean model downscaling and statistical emulation enables us to assess future ocean induced AIS mass loss more accurately and thus reduce uncertainties in its contribution to sea level rise. 2) Our regional fine-resolution coupled ice sheet-ocean model enables us to provide improved projections for ice mass balance and ice sheet movement in the Norwegian administrated Dronning Maud Land sector of Antarctica.

Pelagic and benthic biodiversity shape the strength of this process by governing the amount of organic carbon transferred from the surface to the seafloor sediment, where it may be respired or buried for geological timescales. Despite its importance, it remains unclear whether climate change will weaken or strengthen the biological carbon pump. Filling this knowledge gap is crucial as its weakening would amplify global warming and narrow our chances to meet the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. Yet so far, there is no proxy to reconstruct the biological pump from the sediment record, limiting our capacity to assess its responses to past climate changes and consequently informing us on its potential functioning under future warmer-than-present climate. Here, we will implement a cross-disciplinary approach to develop ancient plankton DNA as a proxy for reconstructing the past functioning of the biological carbon pump. We will utilise a novel observation methodology, based on ancient sedimentary DNA, to recover ancient ocean biodiversity beyond the fossil record. We will combine this new data with relevant existing geochemical, climate and DNA data to study the response of the biological carbon pump to past climate changes. We focus our approach on a unique set of surface sediment samples and three Late Quaternary sediment cores in the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, where carbon sequestration processes via the biological pump are prominent. We will produce the first reconstruction of the biological pump back to the Last Interglacial, a period considered as a future climate analogue.

These perturbations may have profound impacts on marine biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Yet, to date it remains unclear how marine communities respond to environmental change; a gap in knowledge that extends especially to microbial communities.

Any change in their diversity can have wide-ranging consequences for ecosystem health.

In PASTIME, we apply the innovative, cross-disciplinary approach of paleogenomics to investigate for the first time if and how microbial communities changed due to environmental changes in the western Norwegian Masfjorden and the polar Kongsfjorden in Svalbard. Specifically, we adapt sedimentary ancient DNA sequencing to high-resolution fjord sediment cores to define the baseline biodiversity over the last two to four centuries in both fjords. For environmental context, we use existing historical data and generate new data on past temperature, freshwater inflow, oxygen-content, nutrients, and sea ice. Combined, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of fjord ecosystem changes from a pristine state (preindustrial) to a modern state in response to climate change (since ~1850s) and direct anthropogenic pressures (since ~1960s).

We recently discovered genetic locus that dramatically affects the light-dependent process of smoltification, affecting molecular reorganisation of the gill, somatic growth in freshwater, and survival in the seawater cage environment. Because of the remarkable extent of the effects on gill gene expression, we call this locus the hub locus. HubSmoltʼs objectives are therefore to properly characterise the consequences of variation at this locus for smolt development and seawater performance; additionally it will begin the complex process of defining the mechanisms through the hub locus affects smolt phenotype. To meet the HubSmolt objectives we will conduct a new study in pools of fish, homozygous for either the major or minor allele at the hub locus. Fish will be taken through smoltification protocols using short photoperiod or continuous light, with multi-tissue sampling and endocrine monitoring throughout the freshwater phase. This will allow us to define in what tissues, and at what times the hub locus affects development, and to assess the extent to which such effects interact with rearing conditions. Subsequently, fish will be transferred to seawater cages and monitored to commercial slaughter weight. In parallel, we will conduct controlled handling stresses, and SAV3 virus challenges and assess acute and long term immunological and pathological responses.

By improving welfare, the project intends to minimise the environmental impacts of fishing through improvements to sustainability and product quality. Since the re-establishment of the Norwegian ABT quota, the traditional capture method (purse seine) has not been efficient or profitable. As purse seiners target aggregations of fish, animal welfare and product quality are easily compromised. In 2022, only 48% of the 315-tonne purse seine quota was caught. A rod-and-line (R&L) fishery using coastal powerboats has also developed. In 2022, ~100 ABT were caught by R&L for recreational, commercial and scientific purposes. R&L capture overcomes many of the issues associated with purse seine fishing. Catching fish one-by-one gives the opportunity to maintain welfare and quality at the individual level. Norwegian R&L fishing for ABT is therefore well placed to transition towards an animal welfare conscious and environmentally sustainable fish capture method.

The use of plant ingredients in salmon feed has introduced mycotoxins orally for the first time to carnivorous marine farmed fish. In global terrestrial animals farming, mycotoxins are well known to cause production diseases like those reported in aquaculture. Disrupted health, reduced growth and increased mortality caused by mycotoxin contaminated feed is recognized as one of the most significant hazards and threats to the feed supply chain causing economic losses and impaired animal welfare. A recent study found that >80% of the salmon feeds contain so called emerging mycotoxins, of which enniatins (ENNs) were the most prevalent. The mycotoxin Enniatin B was recently found to impair Atlantic salmon health at levels occasionally found in commercial feeds.

In Norway, this coincides with a tremendous increase in farmed salmon production. These opposing trends have sparked controversy as the association between fish farms and wild salmonids has become increasingly evident. The main impact of fish farming on wild salmon is via the proliferation and spillover of parasitic salmon lice. Although there is no doubt that salmon lice infestations harm salmon, salmonid tolerance limits towards lice remains a critically unresolved question. Knowledge on the lice tolerance limits, derived mostly from laboratory studies using farmed salmon, has been the basis for management interventions. However, current understanding of lice thresholds inflicting sublethal effects and decreased wild fish survival in natural environments is critically limited. As there are >400 salmon rivers in Norway, the only feasible way to assess the effect of salmon lice on the survival of wild smolts is to use models. Consequently, the main objective of Hitlice is to improve existing models by providing an accurate estimate of the relationship between salmon lice and the marine survival of salmon smolts. To this end, examining lice threshold levels by field and lab experiments with artificial infestation of wild fish will be performed. To test direct and indirect effect of lice under variable environmental conditions, results will be compared with time series from tagged wild salmon, and in addition from rivers with estimated smolt migration and return rates. In turn, model accuracy will be tested.

JPI-007 ,Active,Impacts of artificial light at night on pelagic ecosystems in European seas (ALANIS) ,JPI Oceans,Project,"Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, Institute for Carbon Cycles",Germany ,"In aquatic environments natural light not only determines the rate of photosynthesis as primordial energy source but also critically influences trophic interactions throughout the entire food web. Light modulates visual predation by many predators as well as predation avoidance strategies by the prey and thus structures the vertical organization of aquatic ecosystems. The classical diel vertical migration of zooplankton to avoid predation during daytime and facilitate their own predation on surface phytoplankton is controlled by ambient light and is influenced especially by light intensities at night. Alterations of light, such as a general reduction of underwater light intensity due to coastal darkening and additional light at night from artificial light sources (ALAN) have the potential to strongly effect zooplankton diel migration patterns with consequences to whole marine ecosystems. In our joint project ALANIS, we will investigate the proliferation of ALAN from coastal activities and shipping and its impact on organismic behaviour such as vertical migration and on key ecosystem functions, while also considering counteracting effects of coastal darkening. We will apply a cross-basin state-of-the-art research pipeline approach, linking spectrally resolved light measurements, single species lab and in situ mesocosm studies, with community-wide field experiments and ecosystem modelling. Experimental and observational study sites will cover a high latitude region, including highly turbid coastal waters, and very clear waters of the Mediterranean. The expected results will provide the necessary fundamental physical characterization of underwater ALAN at different sites and of different types (coastal vs. from ships) and will deliver a comprehensive assessment of zooplankton photo-responsiveness and -behavioural thresholds. Remote sensing data of ocean brightness at night and long-term observations of ocean colour will be used to establish a high-resolution atlas of ALAN for European waters. This ALAN risk map together with the biological and physical knowledge leveraged at the study sites will be integrated into a mechanistic modelling approach for producing a sensitivity map of potential impacts of ALAN and coastal darkening on key ecosystem functions such as export flux. These maps and related project outcomes will be made accessible by a Web-GIS. Collaborative communication, dissemination, and outreach of ALANIS results will efficiently inform decisions and actions of a diverse group of stakeholders. ",01/04/2024,31/03/2028,"Challenge 1: Understand and beat marine pollution, Challenge 2: Protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity, Challenge 10: Restore society’s relationship with the ocean
